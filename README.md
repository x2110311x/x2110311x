# Hi There!
I'm Alex Sweeney.

I am a tech enthusiast, Kent State Computer Science Graduate, and IT Professional from Ohio.

I am heavily involved in several music artist oriented communities in which I write custom Discord bots for.
All of my work is fully available for use, modification and education purposes.

If you appreciate my work, buying me a cup of coffee is appreciated!

## Languages
I primarily write in Python, however, I have experience in Javascript, C++, PowerShell, and Kotlin.


## Support me
